## EARLY YEARS

I grew up in the historic [Lexington, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Massachusetts) just outside Boston. I started working young in typical New England fashion; shoveling snow in the winters and yard work summer through fall. By 14 I had my first year-round job at a local ice cream shop and ever since then I've been hustling. I was a demolition laborer, bagel maker, camp counselor, barista, barback, bartender, fitness instructor, and bicycle mechanic. I had 4am starts and 3am closes, double-shifts (and once a triple), and wherever I went I carried a sense of pride in my work. These jobs were immensely valuable and still shape much of my worldview today. They taught me to gratitude for all working people and how to grind out the mundane.

In high school, I got my first taste of entrepreneurship. I was a sneakerhead and in the absence of StockX, I built a global community marketplace of 15k+ members on Facebook. It taught me the world was a lot smaller on the internet and it was my first taste of building something of my own.

I went to NYU for chemical engineering, the first in my family to go to college. I wanted to fix the psychopharmaceutical industry, something personal to me, but quickly realized drug discovery moved too slow for my temperament. I spent most of my time in NYU's entrepreneurship community instead.

During my undergrad, I had a serendipitous and formative work experience at [Joe & the Juice](https://www.ft.com/content/af63cf37-048d-4d8b-bb79-5b4c8d7c960c). I started working as a barista at their first NYC location and ended up as a global recruiter, flying out to open stores in Miami, San Francisco, and Sydney. As a barista recruiter my job was to walk into cafes, spot high-energy baristas, and convince them on the spot to join us at Joe. I had a lot of fun and learned how to conquer the discomfort of rejection.

I had three other work experiences in college that left an impression on me. First, I landed a prestigious internship at [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/credit.html?gad_campaignid=22525387591&gbraid=0AAAAApmcuzrlzcgcrNUeKFpTOi2qSb9jJ) on the options product line team where I learned I didn't care about socially constructed career prestige. Second, I spent a summer in Cyprus building a coworking space and incubating startups, working with local government where I learned my love for travel was secondary to my love for home. Third, I tutored computer science at NYU where I learned I loved to educate.

## CRYPTO

I found crypto the way a lot of people did in 2017 out of necessity. I needed Bitcoin to buy fake IDs. I wondered why I couldn't just use dollars so I read the Bitcoin whitepaper and fell down the rabbit hole. Decentralized networks became an obsession.

After graduating in spring 2020, right into COVID, I spent four months in Hawaii glued to DeFi summer and studying smart contracts. I started my first "real" job at [Pariveda Solutions](https://parivedasolutions.com/) in fall 2020 as a software consultant. Despite the incredible mentorship and work environment there, I couldn't focus. I had a compulsion to build alternative financial systems. 

I joined [Delphi Digital's](https://delphidigital.io/) intern program, working nights and weekends for free until they gave me a full-time offer. I became the venture arm's "infrastructure guy", evaluating blockchains, applied cryptography, and other infra-focused companies. In mid-2022 I began pushing the team to spend more time on AI and led our first investments.

In late 2023 I joined [=nil; Foundation](https://nil.foundation/) after months of research on zero-knowledge proofs. My thesis was that ZKP proof generation was approaching the economic threshold for practical use cases beyond blockchains. I was wrong. I had joined as CPO, spent seven months shutting down projects and focusing the team, then took over as CEO. Amongst the many things any CEO is responsible for, I led our 60-person team through our first major product launch, managed investor relations, and built our developer ecosystem to 50+ partners. Unfortunately, we never cracked ZK beyond blockchains.

I left =nil; Foundation in April 2025. Despite holding the CEO title, I came to understand that I didn't have the authority to create change. 

## CURRENTLY

I spent a few months  traveling, meditating, and exploring what's next. Similar to my professional beginnings in crypto, last summer a casual interest turned into an obsession — this time, robotics.

In August 2025, I started DRZ Capital with my best friend to invest in robotics companies. We were backed by a large family office and ran a couple of SPVs. I visited top labs across North America, met with dozens of founders, and built a network of researchers, hardware specialists, and enterprise buyers.

Ultimately, my heart drew me back to operating. The opportunity to deploy frontier foundation models into the real-world was too great to passively participate.

Now I'm looking for full-time roles to do just that.
