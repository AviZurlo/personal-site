# About Me

I grew up in Lexington, just outside Boston, and started working young. By 12 I was shoveling driveways for cash. By 14 I had my first year-round job. Through high school and college I worked as an ice cream scooper, demolition laborer, bagel maker, camp counselor, barista, barback, bartender, fitness instructor, and bicycle mechanic. These jobs taught me how to work with people and how to grind.

In high school I got really into sneakers and built a community around buying and selling through Facebook groups. It was my first taste of building something online — coordinating strangers around a shared obsession.

I went to NYU for chemical engineering, the first in my family to go to college. I wanted to fix the psychopharmaceutical industry, something personal to me, but quickly realized drug discovery moved too slowly for my temperament. I spent most of my time in NYU's entrepreneurship community instead — annual hackathons, startup ideas in food & beverage, agtech, and news media.

One of my favorite jobs was at Joe & the Juice during their NYC expansion. I started as a barista and ended up as a global recruiter, flying out to open stores in Miami, San Francisco, and Sydney. I spent a summer in Cyprus with one of the execs building a coworking space and incubating startups, working with local government. It was formative, but I realized my heart was back home.

I found crypto the way a lot of people did in 2017 — I needed Bitcoin to buy something online (fake IDs for friends, if we're being honest). I wondered why I couldn't just use dollars, read the Bitcoin whitepaper, and fell down the rabbit hole. Decentralized networks became my new obsession.

After graduating in spring 2020, right into COVID, I spent four months in Hawaii glued to DeFi summer and Ethereum. I also started taking drawing seriously. Before my first "real" job I worked at a bike shop for store credit and earned enough to buy my Scott Addict RC 10 — still my main ride.

I joined Delphi Digital's intern program, working nights and weekends for free until they gave me a full-time offer. I became their infrastructure guy: blockchains, applied cryptography, Layer 1s and 2s. By mid-2022 I was pushing the team to spend more time on AI.

In late 2023 I joined =nil; Foundation after months of research on zero-knowledge proofs. My thesis was that ZKP proof generation was about to become abundant. I was wrong — the timeline was longer than I thought. I joined as CPO, spent seven months shutting down projects and focusing the team, then took over as CEO. I led our 60-person globally distributed team through a product launch, managed our investors (Polychain, Blockchain Capital, IOSG), and built our developer ecosystem to 50+ partners.

I left in April 2025 and spent time traveling, meditating, and figuring out what's next. Like summer 2020, a casual interest turned into an obsession — this time, robotics.

I started DRZ Capital with my best friend to invest in robotics companies. We're backed by a $100M+ family office and led a $12.5M SPV into Apptronik. I've visited labs across North America, met with dozens of founders, and built a network of researchers, hardware specialists, and enterprise buyers.

Now I'm looking for full-time roles where robot foundation models meet real-world deployment. I want to be in the room where these systems go from demo to production.
